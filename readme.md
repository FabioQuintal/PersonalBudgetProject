# Personal Budget

>This is a simple CRUD API of an personal budget. In this project, i focused on using Express routers and NodeJS to record my knowledge of these technologies. For now, i didn't focused on data validation and saving data into a database. The next steps will be creating a front-end and connecting this API to database.
